# HobbyHelper
<p>HobbyHelper is a PERN Stack web application using TypeScript, Redux, and React Router to provide an encylcopedia of Hobbies, and eventually quiz based recommendations, to anyone interested.</p>

## Development
<p>This application was developed as part of my Capstone project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Remote Program, and marks my first ever use of Redux, TypeScript, and React Router inside any application. Part of the requirements for the project was to learn something new, so of course I picked 3 new technologies to learn instead of one. It was developed across 2 weeks and reached a functional but unfinished state during that time.</p>

## Ongoing Development
As of 4/8/22, all known bugs have been squashed, and this bug free version of the basic CRUD app are deployed to Heroku:
- Front End: https://shielded-retreat-18321.herokuapp.com/
- Back End: https://ancient-cliffs-31790.herokuapp.com/hobbies<br/>
Moving forward, my main goals are as follow:
- Hobby Recommendation Quiz creation and implementation
- Quiz results recommendation algorithm
- User Authentication
- Persistent Quiz scores based on User Accounts
- Locking certain features behind account creation
  - Adding Hobbies
  - Editing existing Hobbies
  - Hobby deletion reserved for Admins
- Various polish tasks
  - Updating Favicon and Title
  - Automatic casing of editable fields
  - More complete About page
  - Adding Keywords to Search parameters
